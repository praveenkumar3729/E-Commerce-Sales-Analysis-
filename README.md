 ## E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on an E-commerce dataset. The analysis will uncover insights into sales performance, shipping trends, and customer behavior, helping to optimize business strategies.

## Project Overview:

This project leverages Python and various data analysis libraries to manipulate and visualize E-commerce sales data. The dataset includes information on orders, shipping, and product details. Key tasks include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualization of sales patterns, profit distribution, and shipping performance
Identifying trends to support business decisions

## Steps in the Project:

1. *Importing Libraries*
      -pandas for data manipulation
      -plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects for data visualization
   
2.*Loading the Dataset*
      -Reading a CSV file (Sample - Superstore.csv)
       
3.*Initial Data Exploration*
      -Displaying the first few rows (head())
      -Descriptive statistics (describe())
      -Data type information (info())
      
4. *Data Preprocessing*
      -Converting Order Date and Ship Date to DateTime format
   
5.*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
      -Visualizing sales trends over time
      -Analyzing shipping times and identifying patterns
      -Segmenting data by region, category, and sub-category
      
6.*Visualization*
      -Bar plots and line charts for sales and profits
      -Pie charts for category-wise sales distribution
      -Scatter plots for sales vs. profit analysis
